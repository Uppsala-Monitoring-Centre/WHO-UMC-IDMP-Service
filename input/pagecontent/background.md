#### IDMP

IDMP – Identification of Medicinal Products – is a set of five standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to create a universal framework of structured, coded data that uniquely identify and describe all key aspects of medicinal products.
The Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) standards aim to increase clarity and efficiency in communications about medicines and provide greater certainty to patients no matter where they are.

##### PhPID and GSID 

This Implementation Guide is focusing on two parts of the ISO IDMP standard, the Pharmaceutical Product Identifier (PhPID) and the Global Substance Identifier (GSID):
- Pharmaceutical Product Identification – ISO 11616 
- Substance Identification – ISO 11238 

##### Operating model

Following is picture of the operating model for requesting and publishing PhPIDs and it is basically the same for GSIDs.
